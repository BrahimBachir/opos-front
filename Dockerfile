# Stage 1: Build the Angular application
FROM node:19-alpine AS build-stage

# Set the working directory

RUN npm i

# Copy the rest of the application files

# Build the Angular application in production mode
# Replace 'front' with the name of your Angular project (if a different name)
RUN npm run build -- --output-path=./dist/front --configuration=production

# Stage 2: Serve the application with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine AS nginx-stage

# Copy the CORRECT and complete nginx.conf file
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# IMPORTANT CHANGE: Copy the built application from the 'browser' subfolder
#COPY --from=build-stage /app/dist/front/browser /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY --from=build-stage /app/dist/front /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to the host machine
EXPOSE 80

# Command to run Nginx when the container starts
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
